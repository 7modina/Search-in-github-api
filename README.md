Search the github api


### Simple implementation of the API in JavaScript
The function of the application is to search for account information on GitHub through the username entered in the search field
Use fetch twice in this app
The first: in order to obtain the user's name, date of joining, and the link to the user's personal website
Second: In order to obtain the user's repos information
Please give me some feedback if you have any
